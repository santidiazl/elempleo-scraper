# Python elempleo.com scraper

This python script was created to scrape relevant data from software engineering/developer job posts in Colombia's biggest job board website - www.elempleo.com. The scraping of relevant html files was done with the excellent BeautifulSoup library.

The data is then consolidated into a CSV, and that was done with Pandas.

NOTE: I found no policy regarding scraping on El Empleo's website therefore I decided to proceed with the script.
