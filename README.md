# elempleo.com Job Post Scraper

These Python scripts were created to scrape key data points from relevant software engineering/developer job posts from Colombia's biggest job board website - www.elempleo.com. 

The scraping of HTML files is done with the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library.

The data is then consolidated into a CSV and that was done with the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

NOTE: I found no policy regarding scraping on El Empleo's website therefore I decided to proceed with the script.
