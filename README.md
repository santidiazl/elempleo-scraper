# elempleo.com Job Post Scraper

These python scripts were created to scrape relevant data from software engineering/developer job posts in Colombia's biggest job board website - www.elempleo.com. 

The scraping of html files is done with the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library.

The data is then consolidated into a CSV and that was done with the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

NOTE: I found no policy regarding scraping on El Empleo's website therefore I decided to proceed with the script.
